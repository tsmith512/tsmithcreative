title: "React Native: from \"Hello World\" to Noisy Coach in Two Weeks"
summary: >
  With a new job comes a needed familiarity with new tools. For my first
  experiment with React Native, I made a simple interval timer for hangboard
  sets to get stronger, in tech and in tendons, during the plague.

[Having recently moved]({% post_url 2020-02-07-finding-next %}) from a web shop
to a new team that is much more focused on apps and devices, I want to
familiarize myself with the tech we use so I can continue to make strategic
product recommendations.

So I set a goal: zero-to-app-stores with something simple. But what?

Well, it's not revolutionary, but I decided to make an interval timer for sets
on my climbing hangboard. Regardless of other apps that may be available, the
fitness app I already use does _not_ do these well.

<Media type="image" size="" src="/assets/blog/hello-hangboard/hang.jpg" alt="Me, struggling."  />

_**Humble beginnings:** prototype-level design, packing-tape-as-phone-mount, and
just training up a dead hang before moving onto more challenging holds. And I
think it goes without saying that we're not telling my landlord about this._

# Actual Product Requirements:

- Conveniently run on _a_ mobile device I own
- Audio and visual cues to progress through a circuit
- Able to handle the weird nested patterns of sets I'm seeing, like:

<Media type="image" size="mini" src="/assets/blog/hello-hangboard/routine.jpg" alt="Handwritten workout with weird pattern"  />

_Unlike common "work" vs "rest" timers that repeat, these sets have weird patterns that are hard to set timers for or count off in my head._

## Professional Development <del>Requirements</del> Goals

- Mobile _app,_ built on a common stack and something
  [Very](https://www.verypossible.com) is currently using
- Cross-platform

Already knowing some JavaScript, I opted for **[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/).**
I haven't used React on the web (yet) but it's hugely popular so learning it
will be useful. Also, we've increasingly seen clients opt for React Native over
platform-specific codebases. For many applications, maintaining one central JS
codebase that leverages bindings to native libraries and elements is both easier
to hire for and less expensive to maintain than entirely disparate codebases.

# Getting Started and Expo

The first page of React Native's
["Setting up the development environment"](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
tutorial directs new developers to [Expo](http://expo.io/) for a quick start.

Expo offers a ready-to-use bundling of tools and services with a baseline set of
packages/components. Its local scripts and its SaaS platform handle all the
bundling and building; no Android Studio or Xcode. Perfect for the "Hello World
phase."

``` js
{% raw %}// DO NOT COPY THIS! This is learning scratchwork, not best practices patterns.

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

export default class HelloHangboard extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <View style={{flex: 1, justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center"}}>
        <Text style={{textAlign: "center", fontSize: 32}}>Hello, Hangboard.</Text>
        <Text style={{textAlign: "center"}}>
          I'm stuck in my apartment because of coronavirus.
        </Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}{% endraw %}
```

**Observations on Expo:** Expo offers _so much_ "for free." It's also upfront
about the [limitations](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/why-not-expo/).
This was a fantastic way to start, limiting the number of new things I had to
learn _simultaneously._ (Limit the <abbr title="Work In Progress">WIP</abbr>,
yo!) But I started running into trouble with sounds. Also, compiled binaries,
which came from Expo's SaaS platform, were _large._

**Observations on component building:** As an industry, we spent a long time
highlighting the wisdom of separating concerns into separate files: HTML for
content, CSS for appearance, and JS for interactive function. Bringing CSS into
JS (and the _multitude_ of _conflicting_ practices for doing so) and using JSX
templating for HTML/Content-in-JS both felt very odd, but I will learn. And I
get it now: that was (and still is, to a certain extent) for _webpage_ building,
which this _isn't_ &mdash; this is application scaffolding. So I can see the
argument for a consolidation of "UI, appearance, behavior" and opting for
separation of _feature_ as more sustainable. Hell, that's how I write a backlog.

An immediate plus, though: UI layout with Flexbox is pretty fantastic.

``` js
{% raw %}// DO NOT COPY THIS! This is learning scratchwork, not best practices patterns.

  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

  _exit = () => {
    this.props.navigation.navigate('Welcome');
  }

    return (

## Leaving Expo

I "ejected" my app from Expo for a few reasons:

- iOS wouldn't rapidly seek/replay [Expo AV](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/av/)
  `Audio` objects, even though it worked fine on Android.
- Expo includes a bloat that I _wasn't_ using.
- I wanted to manage iOS and Android builds myself to learn how, then
  involve our CI/CD provider.
- I could still use Expo packages as part of a
  "<abbr title="React Native without Expo">bare workflow</abbr>" project.

[Running `expo eject`](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/bare/customizing/)
was straightforward. Expo's scripts generate the `android` and `ios` folders
and set them both up with build scripts and config.

**Observations:**

- Expo Eject left in React Native Unimodules, which accounts for a lot of the
  bloat. Removing it will require editing platform-specific code, though.
- Eject did not produce a good `.gitignore` for the platform-specific builds, so
  I ended up with a few things in version control that I have since learned
  should be downloaded or generated.

# Development Environments

Normally, I build on Linux. I wanted to give Windows development a shot since it
is easier to connect my phone to my PC than a Linux VM/container.

<Media type="image" size="" src="/assets/blog/hello-hangboard/win-dev-env.png" alt="Windows / Android Studio Environment"  />

React Native's [environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
docs are great. I got Windows (for Android) and macOS (for iOS _and_ Android)
set up quickly.

<Media type="image" size="" src="/assets/blog/hello-hangboard/mac-double-dev-env.png" alt="macOS / Xcode/iOS and Android Studio Environment"  />

**Observations:**

_Mac Stuff:_

- As with Linux, I'm using [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and
  manage Node versions on my Mac, rather than using Homebrew.

_Windows Stuff:_

- Microsoft's tutorial
  ["Set up your Node.js development environment directly on Windows"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/nodejs/setup-on-windows)
  made this really easy.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for Windows _(as in the canonical git package,)_
  is in a **much** better place since last I checked.
  - **However,** it provides &mdash; what I think &mdash; is poor help text and
    default for config
    [`core.autocrlf`](https://help.github.com/en/github/using-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings).
    The default value is `true`, which sets `CRLF` (OS-native) line endings on
    all text files _on checkout_ and always _commits_ `LF` endings into the
    repo. I have always written source files with `LF` endings only, even on
    Windows. Setting that config to `input` will leave files as-is in the
    working tree. Files will commit with `LF` endings, and new files checked out
    will come out as they're committed.
- [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows)
  works well, but it does not appear to read `.nvmrc` files correctly?
- On Windows, all of this works better in PowerShell than Command prompt or
  [Cygwin Bash](https://www.cygwin.com/). I am not currently using
  [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-about).
- I had to edit the environment variable config for Android Studio.
  Specifically, the `PATH` additions for Windows weren't right in React Native's
  environment tutorials. Watch where Android Studio installs itself, its SDKs,
  and the Platform Tools.

<Media type="image" size="mini" src="/assets/blog/hello-hangboard/win-env-var.png" alt="Windows environment variables"  />

_On Windows, Android Studio installed itself **and the Android SDKs/tools** in `%LOCALAPPADATA%`, not the drive root._

``` bash
[tsmith@macbook][~/Documents/repos/HelloHangboard] →  cat ~/.bash_profile | tail -n 5
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

_On Mac, Android Studio is in my local user's Library &mdash; consistent with RN's docs._

# Building Release Packages

Next, building installable packages. That wasn't bad. Initially, I wasn't sure
the names for "app version that wants to connect to the JS bundler service"
(`debug`) versus "app version that is packaged and ready to use on your phone
now" (`release`).

The ["Running on Device"](https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device)
tutorial explains how to build both, but there are enough foundational steps
explained concurrently that it feels clearer in retrospect having done it.


_**iOS:**_

``` bash
# Debug
[tsmith@macbook][~/Documents/repos/HelloHangboard] → npx react-native run-android
```

<Media type="image" size="mini" src="/assets/blog/hello-hangboard/mac-xc-build-conf.png" alt="Xcode Project Scheme Build Configuration"  />

_For Release: In the Project menu in Xcode, select "Edit Schemes" to change the build config, then Build the project._


_**Android:**_

``` powershell
# Debug
PS C:\Users\tsmith\HelloHangboard> npx react-native run-android

# Release
PS C:\Users\tsmith\HelloHangboard\android> .\gradlew assembleRelease
```

I ran into a conflict between React Native 0.61.4 and Android's SDK 29. The
connection from the debug release back to the Metro JS bundler is insecure,
which the upgraded Android SDK disallows by default. This broke `debug` builds
on both platforms. [Tom at Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56808180)
offered a Manifest to disable this for `debug` builds only, which fixed it.

``` xml
<!-- HelloHangboard/android/app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW"/>
    <application android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"
      tools:targetApi="28" tools:ignore="GoogleAppIndexingWarning" />
</manifest>
```

_And there it is!_

## Building with CI/CD

Next, I wanted to get [Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io/), one of our CI/CD
platforms, building cross-platform for commits to `master`.

That was fairly straightforward except for code signing, which caused issues
building locally, too, but quickly became a showstopper:

- Code Signing for Android is a moderate annoyance, but producing and using a
  key locally is well documented, and all you have to do is just keep using it.
  Uploading that key to Bitrise was easy, but I had to add the signing step to
  the workflow.
- Code Signing for iOS is (currently, to me) profoundly difficult to untangle
  _if you run into a problem._ Xcode seems to imply that it can all be done
  within the application, but no cert I provisioned within Xcode's Preferences
  would work with Very's Team (nor my "Personal Team" either). And once I got it
  on Bitrise, I started having Provisioning Profile problems on top of that. All
  despite supposed options for these things to be handled automatically.

![This made me angry.](/assets/blog/hello-hangboard/mad-at-my-computer.gif)

When I threw it all out and started over outside Xcode, it worked fine, first try:

1. Access our corporate Apple Developer Account online.
2. Create a Bundle ID for HelloHangboard (`com.verypossible.hellohangboard`)
   specifically.
3. _From the Apple Developer website_ (not locally in Xcode), create a
   Distribution certificate to use for my name within Very's org.
4. Again, _from the Apple Developer website,_ create a Provisioning Profile
   matching: that cert, intended for Apple Distribution, on that Bundle.
5. Downloading and importing those things into Xcode, then uploading to Bitrise.

- Using Bitrise's [codesigndoc](https://github.com/bitrise-io/codesigndoc) tool
  to pull these from Xcode automatically would have been simple had the certs
  worked. But they didn't.

Clearly, iOS Code Signing is the part of this I had the most trouble with, and
need to study more about. I _felt_ like it should be simple and that I knew what
was going on &mdash; it just kept not working, even though all the IDs
matched every time.

<Media type="image" size="" src="/assets/blog/hello-hangboard/bitrise-workflows.png" alt="Side by side workflows in Bitrise"  />

Once that was cleared up, the Bitrise workflow config was not difficult. In
separate workflows for iOS and Android, I have these basic steps:

1. Load SSH key for the repo and clone it
2. `npm install`
3. (iOS) Auto Provision (pulls in and confirms the cert and provisioning profile)
4. Install either Android components/modules and iOS CocoaPods
5. Override/increment the project version and build code based on the Bitrise build number
6. Build
7. (Android) Sign, which happens post-compile, with the key I made locally.
8. Save binaries to Bitrise and my S3 backup bucket
9. Upload directly to App Store Connect and Google Play Console

<Media type="image" size="mini" src="/assets/blog/hello-hangboard/bitrise-log.png" alt="Bitrise build log"  />

With workflow triggers, any commit on `master` will run `ios` and `android`
workflows sequentially. Once uploaded, they can be easily released to testers.

Or so I thought.

# App Store Connect and Google Play Console

If Android's Code Signing was an easy hoop to jump through, it was Apple's
chance to sign when getting into App Store Connect.

<Media type="image" size="mini" src="/assets/blog/hello-hangboard/app-store-testflight.png" alt="Version 1.0.32 on TestFlight"  />

I had a Beta Reviewed app on TestFlight and working on my iPhone (and Dad's!)
within 48 hours.

Google Play Console, on the other hand, has a rather opaque approach to letting
me know how long I will be "pending."

<Media type="image" size="mini" src="/assets/blog/hello-hangboard/a-bit-more-time.png" alt="Google Play Console 'A bit more time'"  />

I do like how Play Console offers more robust release tracks for Internal,
(Closed) Alpha, (Open) Beta, and Production releases, but makes it _very_
difficult to understand what part you're waiting on. At present, I have the
1.0.32 release "fully rolled out" (their words) in the Internal and closed
Alpha.

<Media type="image" size="mini" src="/assets/blog/hello-hangboard/play-release-tracks.png" alt="Version 1.0.32 not available on Google Play"  />

But I can't get a link or an email invite to share, nor can I even get it
installed on my own device registered with this account. Thankfully side-loading
apps in Android is easy, so I've just done that and moved on with life.

_Certainly,_ I understand slower processing from any business in this time, but
it has been well over a week. _I am happy to wait!_ However, what is _not_
obvious from this console or any help docs is: _are they waiting on me?_
Or _I am waiting_ on something from them? And
[this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48256603/where-is-the-opt-in-url)
[isn't](https://forum.unity.com/threads/i-cant-seem-to-access-my-google-play-alpha-release.507570/)
[an uncommon](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/9ufgek/why_is_googles_alphabeta_apk_distribution_so_bad/)
[question](https://www.reddit.com/r/androiddev/comments/cgb6zy/how_to_set_up_an_app_for_internal_testing/)
outside "coronatime" either.

<Media type="image" size="mini" src="/assets/blog/hello-hangboard/play-problem.png" alt="This feels like conflicting language"  />

_This screenshot, from StackOverflow, is what I see too. It feels like conflicting language: "Released, full roll-out" versus "No link or email invites until you publish."_

Community responses vary between "it's just a matter of time, you have to wait"
to "click X magic button in Y console page," but none of Google's official
documentation clarify how one should resolve what feels like a stall.

{% update 2020-05 %}
I did not realize that getting a Closed Alpha on Google Play would involve
Google reviewing not only the app, but also the store description. In a first
draft, I used the word "coronavirus" &mdash; in a subsequent draft, I removed
that but referenced "stay-at-home orders" instead &mdash; as a reason someone
might want to try training on a hangboard at home. I don't know which version
they read, because you can't peg drafts of the store listing to releases in the
app. But whichever it was, _they did not like it._

Google was putting any app mentioning the current situation through extra
scrutiny, **and rightly so.** But I wish I had known that my draft description
was going up for review, too, even for an invite-only release. Turns out, on
review, Google suspended by Play Console account (like, can't log in anymore
suspended). I had to appeal this decision, promising to rewrite the description.
Thankfully, there was no objectionable content in the app itself, so that made
for an easier plea. My account was reinstated and I was able to submit a new
version with a new description shortly thereafter.

So, _my bad,_ but my critique on the opacity of this process in the UI stands.
{% endupdate %}

# Recap and Roadmap

That was fun. Having little to do most evenings made it happen faster...

**What I've built meets my MVP objectives for:**

- Usable interval timer for the hangboard for me and friends! <del>with iPhones
  _(Android friends coming soon, I guess)._</del>
- First React Native exposure, introduction to how it works, how it builds, and
  an intro to the nature of its cross-platform abilities.
- First Play Console and App Store Connect process exposure so I can help guide
  clients through this part of the process.

**Things that are needed, in a rough priority order:**

<Media type="image" size="mini" src="/assets/blog/hello-hangboard/vanilla-sky.jpg" alt="Me"  />

- _Being able to climb outside again&hellip;_
- This _desperately_ needs a code review. There are competing examples for how
  to write ES6 generally and React-specific patterns, even within React Native
  and Expo's tutorials. And even with what I already know, I could start to
  unify it.
- After "is it structured to best practices," then "is it written properly?"
  I need to add linting. It compiles but I know but it ain't pretty.
- Learn more about classes vs functional exports, and why object-oriented class
  structures seem to have fallen out of style within the JS community just in
  time for me to start using them.
- A more sustainable way to handle CSS-in-JS than per-component `StyleSheet`
  objects with no shared attributes.
- More circuits and resources &mdash; I couldn't imagine releasing this app
  publicly in its limited form.
- The visual design <del>is super utilitarian</del> needs _help._

React Native did get me from "I wonder what it would be like to build a mobile
app" to having a compiled app running on both major platforms on physical
devices in my hands in record time. I can definitely see why this approach has
gained traction so quickly when it's well-suited. The intimidating part was the
number of moving pieces through many levels of abstraction, but the community is
active and documentation is evolving quickly to help with that.

Meanwhile, I've got my sadistic strength trainer hanging over the stairs and two
phones to holler at me to use it every day. That might be it for a while.

Stay healthy, folks. We'll be back together one day. I'm looking forward to it.
