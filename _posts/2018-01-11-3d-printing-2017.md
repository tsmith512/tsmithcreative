title: 3D Printing Misadventures in 2017
summary: >
  Last Christmas, I received a Monoprice Maker Select 3D printer. Getting
  started with 3D printing was fun, occasionally frustrating, and easier than I
  had expected.

Thanks to the fantastic [3D Printing Subreddit][SUBREDDIT] and my friend
[George Louthan][G] (of [roadtrip fame][TQ]), I became convinced of two things:
first, that I needed a 3D printer in my life; second, that the
[Monoprice Maker Select V2][MSV2] was a good entry point because it was an
inexpensive but well-reviewed printer.

# The First Days

I jumped into [Thingiverse][TV] and started printing little trinkets that others
had designed. This helped me see what was possible, what kinds of prints were
easy or difficult, and how to optimize settings for A) the printer generally and
B) individual models specifically.

## Raspberry Pi Case and OctoPrint

I started using [OctoPrint][OP] to manage the printer instead of loading files
from the SD card. My first print from OctoPrint was [a case][RPCASE] for the
Raspberry Pi B+ I was using to host it.

## Benchy

Because of course I did this. Printing the "[Benchy][B]" is apparently a rite of
passage; it's a wildly popular but tricky model to print correctly, so it's
useful for diagnostics and finer optimizations. I had under extrusion problems
across the model which I worked on and resolved.

## Functional Prints

Most of my printing this year took the form of "if you have a hammer suddenly
everything looks like a nail." Proudly, I set out to solve my world's problems
with plastic doodads, mostly designed using [SketchUp][SKU].

- Polaroid Cube mount to attach to a GoPro suction cup mount
- A dual-phone mount for a Google Pixel and Nexus 5X for the [roadtrip][TQ]

- Pencil cup that attaches to a monitor stand
- Tablet stand for the 3D printing area which shows the OctoPrint interface

- Camera strap holder for the cabinet I keep photography stuff in

I also printed cable runners, desktop stuff, memory card cases, and little
display mounts for memorabilia.

# Bigger Projects

I have a few notable 3D printing projects from this year.

## The Brake Line Holders

![Brake Lines](/assets/blog/3d-printing-2017/brakes.jpg)

I have an ancient pickup that needs a little love. One easy problem: the
brackets that hold some hydraulic lines had broken. With calipers and many
rounds of revisions, I printed a set of four that twist into the hole in the
engine bay wall that will retain those lines in place.

This was the first time I used [OpenSCAD][OSCAD], and I pushed the
[project to GitHub][BLGH]. I enjoyed being able to use code to build this
because it is mathematically precise and repetitive. Building this with a
visually-driven tool would have been frustrating. Also, source control for
versioning is convenient. I appreciated not only that GitHub will visualize
STL files in the repo with an interactive 3D viewer, but individual commits or
PRs will show
<span style="color:#00cc00">additions</span> and
<span style="color:#ff0000">deletions</span> to the volume:

[This commit][C] enlarged one channel and replaced the clip (which worked with
the original nylon part but not in PLA) with a solid piece that twists into the
wall.

PLA isn't an ideal material for this purpose because it's brittle and heat
intolerant but I was prototyping these in winter and they survived a Texas
summer, still in place almost a year later with no distortion.

## Theatrical Props for _Catch Me If You Can_

Each fall, I do graphic design for the high school fall musical at
[St. Andrew's Episcopal School][SAES]. This year, they performed
_[Catch Me If You Can][CMIYC],_ a musical based on the movie based on the
autobiographical novel by Frank Abagnale, Jr. about his string of fraudulent
escapades which included flying for [PanAm][PAWA].

The costume designer couldn't find affordable PanAm pilot wing pins. I mentioned
that I might not be able to replicate the vintage pins but that I could produce
plastic ones modeled after the illustration I used in the poster.

![CMYIC Art Sample](/assets/blog/3d-printing-2017/cmiyc.jpg)

This was awesome. Beyond a printed piece, which I make frequently, this felt
like a more substantial physical output from my graphic design work. Further,
theatrical costumes/props often exaggerate sizes or relationships for
visibility. Original pins would have been barely visible, but the extra-large
ones we printed read naturally on stage. They were printed in black PLA which the
costume designer painted with model paints.

Getting an SVG from Illustrator into SketchUp requires either buying the premium
edition of SketchUp or jumping through intermediary applications to do multiple
file type conversions. I did the first round with SketchUp using the now-defunct 123Design for the SVG import. I did the final version with
[Autodesk Fusion 360][A360] instead. It is much more reliable with
STL export and natively supports SVG imports. It's also free for hobbyists!

![Wings Model in Fustion 360](/assets/blog/3d-printing-2017/wings-model.png)

I find it less flexible with shape building than SketchUp, but I'm also very new
to it. SVG import is great. I really dislike that it runs "in the cloud" and
makes it nearly impossible to just store things locally. I'm working
individually so having an application that can run locally/offline as well as
let me store working files alongside my STL and GCODE exports would be
preferable.

**Shoutout to George** for helping me bulk-print these with his delta printer
because&mdash;

# Then it Broke or "Do the Mosfet Mod"

Despite looking at modding tutorials for the Maker Select, I never stumbled upon
the Mosfet mod until it was too late. While printing a prototype of the pilot
wings, I suddenly smelled dying electronics, and just as quickly it was without
power. This is a known design flaw of the Maker Select as well as the numerous
printers which are also derived from the Prusa i3:

Power for the heated bed runs through the printer's main board which _shouldn't_
handle that current and out to the bed via connectors that _cannot_ handle it.
The Mosfet kit adds [an additional board][MSBOARD] with traces and connectors
rated for the heated bed power requirements. It uses the connection to the main
board to activate a relay. This keeps the "big current" on the Mosfet board with
only minimal needs running through the main board to activate the relay.

Thankfully, I was still under warranty so I sent the printer off to Monoprice
for repair. When I received it back, I saw that the new board had better
connectors but didn't appear to have a beefier channel for that power to run
through, so I installed the Mosfet upgrade by following the excellent guide by
[Brett at Let's Print 3D][MOSFET].

I may need to make the cables from the PSU to the Mosfet board longer because
I don't think I can put the case back together as-is, but this is connected
and working properly

# A Retro

## What went well in 2017?

- Started from zero experience with 3D printing
- Created a lot of moderately intricate widgets which were useful
- Learned more about SketchUp (which I had used previously in theatrical design)
- Got an introduction to OpenSCAD and Fusion 360 as alternatives
- Used 3D printing to solve a theatre problem
- Fire hazard aside, the Maker Select was a great entry point for me

## What to change in 2018?

I was not adventurous with modeling, and have only minimal experience with
design applications outside of SketchUp. Further, my primary use for the printer
was to build utilitarian things, so while I'm proud of the forms I created,
those ideas didn't come from a visually creative mindset. Now that I have a
printer that is less likely to catch fire and I've done a survey of 3D printing
basics, I'd like to design more creative/decorative models with other
applications and possibly different materials.
