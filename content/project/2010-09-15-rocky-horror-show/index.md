<p>Third Floor was asked to revamp the traditional "Rocky Horror Show" imagery for this year's production, which is being held at The Joint, a new, huge, and advanced theatrical venue at the Hard Rock Casino (formerly the Cherokee Nation Casino) in northeast Tulsa. The show itself was being redesigned with an 80's/Club Kids theme.</p><p>Initially, I found the task of re-imagining Rocky Horror as very daunting because of its iconic status. However, this production must cater to a different audience. Traditional Rocky Horror fans will show up regardless of the Club Kids influence and Casino location or they will be so turned off by both that they won't go. I decided they are not the primary audience for this communication. Instead, any production collateral must engage the casino audience and show them that this is Rocky Horror in a new way.</p><p>The playing card was a possible use. In previous years, the Tulsa production has made business-card sized flyers that can be handed out among potential audience members. I designed an Ace of Spades (which, upon further consideration, might more appropriately have been a Queen of Spades) featuring Frank N. Furter.</p><p>I wish my friends in the company all the best. Break a leg this Halloween!</p>
