<p>Gospel, Grits, and Gershwin is an annual weekend brunch event for Booker T. Washington (a Tulsa high school) which features performances by the Jazz Band, Gospel Choir, and other groups. The invitation has been mailed; the program and signage are both pending.</p><p>The invitation combines newer trends in design with basic staples of 1920's Jazz era posters: bold colors, harsh diagonals, stylized figures, and geometric type. It was important to merge this with the youth of the performers as a high school with such a rich history continues in a strong tradition, not only in academics, but also in the arts. I am honored to have been selected to support them in their efforts to fund their programs.</p>
