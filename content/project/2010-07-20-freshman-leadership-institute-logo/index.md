The University of Tulsa's Freshman Leadership Institute is being restructured with a new focus on empowering students with real world advice (often referred to as "tools for success" in the brief) and on student retention. The new program had six areas of focus, one for each of the six scheduled meetings throughout the freshman year. I developed three logo concepts for them:

1.  A young, technical logo emphasizing the number 6, as requested. This was the client selection.
2.  A concept visualizing "tools for success" balancing the line between playful and sophisticated. My personal favorite.
3.  A more corporate, traditional logo featuring six elements, as requested.
