<p>Tulsa Camerata, a chamber music group in Tulsa, called me back after the success of <a href="/project/tulsa-camerata-brochure">last year's piece</a>. They continue on their successful journey to interest a younger audience in an energetic way to this very traditional musical form. This year, they wanted a brochure mailer with a poster-back that outlined the season. The feel needed to be elegant, fancier than last year, but still youthful and exciting. &nbsp;Photography was provided with pre-applied grunge effects, so I played off that making a poster-sized compilation and laid formal type above.</p>
