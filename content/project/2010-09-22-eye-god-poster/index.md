<p>Third Floor Design was asked to develop proposals of posters for Theatre Pops's production of Eye of God, am engaging dark play with religious commentary about the murder of a woman by the ex-con she married. The original photo was manipulated in several ways in Photoshop in order to give a haunting/disturbed quality to the light, with special attention paid to the gutted tree, which overshadows the church house in the image. I thoroughly enjoyed reading the play and am excited to see where Theatre Pops will take it. Break a leg!</p>
