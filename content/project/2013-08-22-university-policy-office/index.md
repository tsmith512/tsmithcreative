  The University of Texas at Austin's Policy Office has a complex workflow for
  the drafting and review of policy documents. Documents must have a rich audit
  history as they are circulated to various departments who may or may not be
  allowed to edit, may or may not be allowed to request changes, or simply
  offer comments. This "routing" history, along with each approved and published
  revision of the document must be available for the UPO and legal teams, while
  the most recent approved version must be easily accessible to the public.

The University Policy Office at The University of Texas at Austin needed a new website as part of its effort to consolidate and modernize several partially overlapping repositories of active and obsolete policy documents into the new Handbook of Operating Procedures. The new site needed to also capture the history of authoring, drafting, routing/revisions, and publication for these policy documents as well as the "kick-off" document for each policy or policy revision, called a Policy Impact Statement (which essentially proposes a policy need and expected outcome, to begin the policy drafting process).

I assisted our Product Owner by diving into the needs of the policy office and helped communicate feedback to developers and perform functional testing of their components. I also designed the Policy Dashboard, Workflow Checklist (an interactive routing sheet), and made several UX enhancements to our system and Drupal's admin interface.
