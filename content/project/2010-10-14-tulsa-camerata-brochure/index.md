<p>Third Floor Design connected me with the Tulsa Camerata, a chamber music group in Tulsa. They aim to interest a younger audience in an energetic way to this very traditional musical form. They wanted a modern brochure that incorporated something of Tulsa. I felt it prudent to gain inspiration from traditional musical performance collateral and then giving it a modern twist. I took the HDR Photo on the front cover in Downtown Tulsa in the 5th and Boston Avenue area because of the unification of many generations of well-known Tulsan architecture (as far back as 1920's art deco) in a single view, as Tulsa Camerata infuses a young life in otherwise older music.</p>
