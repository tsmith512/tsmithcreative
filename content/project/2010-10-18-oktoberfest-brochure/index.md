<p>Oktoberfest contacted me to revamp their annual booklet/brochure. Traditionally, they have produced a half-letter book of at least twenty pages, costing approximately $30,000. I worked with their executive director to determine what was necessary to include and what could be stripped out. We ultimately decided on using a folded tabloid brochure reminiscent of an amusement park map. From there, I used the original poster art from Gorfam Marketing to style a layout that organized as much information as possible into the smallest size possible. This reduced their ultimate printing total down to under $7,000 for 75,000 brochures.</p><p>It must also be noted that the event map and the new identity (which was developed in 2008) were skillfully designed by TU graduate Ruby Whitney. It was a privilege to step in and continue in her absence as she thrives in New York City.</p>
