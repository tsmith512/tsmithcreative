My Packaging Design class this spring explored several different assignments, among them:

**Packaging a Pineapple in an Eco-Friendly Way** - Despite my original question of how to eco-friendly package a product that is traditionally unpackaged, I ultimately decided to use a band of natural gum rubber (which is both reusable and degradable) around the fruit. It was silkscreened inside and out. The inside has potential re-uses for pieces of various sizes and gridlines for cutting.

**Self-Promo Piece** - Self-promotion is terribly difficult. Knowing how crowded stacks of portfolios can become, I decided to reposition my work to the break room by printing on coasters where a hypothetical potential employer could protect his tables by looking at my work every time he or she sets down the coffee mug. The set comes wrapped in a colored resume (it will likely be torn like wrapping paper) and another copy of the resume inside.

**Packaging an Emotion** - Guest Artist Winston Peraza, Creative Director at Cubic, visited and declared our next assignment: package an emotion. I immediately decided to explore curiosity, but that slowly morphed into that darker curiosity. The reason that idiot in the horror films goes out into the woods without a flashlight. The feeling that Lesley Ann Warren (Ms. Scarlet, _Clue_, 1985) had when she opened that black box and said, "A candlestick? What's this for?" The fact that my xacto knife looks pretty scary also made it a little easier. I carved the middle pages out of a sketchbook to hide the knife and designed a book jacket to describe the product. Though as Winston and I both agreed, I could have simply left it in a black book simply marked, "You'll need this."
