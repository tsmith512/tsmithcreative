<p>Greenroom, a new theatre organization in Tulsa, sought to promote local theatre in Tulsa. I had a special passion for this job, given my love of theatre. Developed in parallel with the <a href="/project/downtown-coordinating-council">Downtown Tulsa</a> project, many of the same mechanics were implemented, including the ability for moderated public content submission.&nbsp;</p>
