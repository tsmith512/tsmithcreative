<p>I was honored to serve as a Co-Chair for the American Advertising Federation Tulsa Chapter's 44th Annual ADDY Awards Banquet. I served primarily as their graphic designer, creating an event logo, a Winners Book, the certificate for "Citation of Excellence" Awards (generally known as Silver ADDYs), and a few other odds and ends. The event went very well, and I was very excited to participate.</p><p>AAF-T is preparing to host the 2013 District Convention and as such, is trying to "show off" all things Tulsa all the time. In support of that effort, I decided to shoot a series of photos of major local landmarks with the assistance of good friend <a href="http://bichromephoto.com/" target="_blank">Evan Mackay</a>. In order to make the photos feel more consistent and take a backseat to the outstanding creative work the book is intended to display, I duotoned them with black and simulated reflex blue.</p><p>I was thrilled to have received two Student ADDY awards, one for the <a href="/project/club-209-website-and-photography">Club 209 Website</a> and the <a href="/project/nsac-2010">2010 NSAC Cool Old Guy Plansbook</a>. The Ad Program at TU won several additional awards for both NSAC and the 2010 CUSA Basketball Tournament. Additionally, I was ecstatic to be present when Walsh Branding won not only an ADDY Award but a Best in Show for Print award for their work on the 2009 Annual Report for the Boy Scouts of America Indian Nations Council. I am currently an intern with Walsh Associates, working under Walsh:Barnes Interactive, and was very glad to be present when my friends there were called to the stage.</p><p>As always, I am very grateful for the support and the opportunities that AAF-Tulsa has given me over the past two years.</p>
