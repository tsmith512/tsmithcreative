The Tristesse Grief Center's website was based in a proprietary, inflexible CMS. They sought a volunteer to design and develop a new site, consistent with some of the new branding assets provided by Walsh Branding. Among the features requested were:

*   An events calendar,
*   The ability to display testimonials and stories alongside relevant content,
*   Event registration and payments by PayPal, and
*   A clear division of the site into three primary segments: For Grievers, For Donors, and About The Grief Center.
