<p>Wallace Engineering's website was designed and developed many years ago by Walsh. It was aging quickly, however, because it was a collection of static HTML files and flash-based image galleries. The site design is still fresh and unique, but without the ability to execute their own edits, the content had become old. Wallace asked that the entire site be rebuilt using WordPress to allow for internal management of content and photography.</p>
