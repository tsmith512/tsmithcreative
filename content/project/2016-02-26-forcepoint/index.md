problem: >
  Websense's public facing website was powered by an outdated and inflexible CMS.
  As they prepared for the joint venture with Raytheon to launch Forcepoint,
  significantly expanding their product offerings and target verticals, they
  wanted a path to streamline the management of their content, unify
  internationalized (translated) content rather than having discrete sites, and
  be able to localize (geographic relavence targeting) their website's offerings.

Forcepoint, powered by Raytheon, is the new face of Websense, an enterprise software company developing products and solutions to safeguard users, data, and networks against insider threats and outside attackers, in the cloud, on the road, and in the office. As part of the rebranding effort, Raytheon\|Websense wanted:

- To get off a very outdated and inflexible CMS
- To unify management of multilingual and localized content
- To be more self-sufficient, reducing the need to submit IT Helpdesk tickets for content management or minor feature adjustments
- To retain and expand the deep integration of marketing analytics platforms and lead generation tools

As product owner on the project, I led a team of seven and managed requirements gathering, scope control, story writing, feature prioritization, release planning, and served as the internal client advocate. The new Forcepoint website is a mobile-first responsive Drupal 7 marketing site launched on a short timeline following the announcement of the joint venture between Websense and Raytheon Cyber Products. Editors are able to:

- Reuse content throughout the site to reduce maintenance overhead,
- Translate content into seven core languages in a centralized interface (internationalization),
- Target customizable geographic regions for increased relevance (localization), and
- Receive deeper leads insight through tight integration with Marketo and Tealium.
