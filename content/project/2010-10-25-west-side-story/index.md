<p>I could not have been more excited to be working on another fall musical at St. Andrew's Episcopal School! Rick Garcia, director, initially asked me to produce a backdrop for West Side Story. We went through several design iterations, beginning with a view of the fallen World Trade Center towers symbolizing the escalation of the gang wars of West Side Story to a larger scale: international violence and terrorism. Finally, however, we decided upon using a deconstructed view of the Statue of Liberty, as the production concept turned to focus more on the statue of equality in America, particularly immigration issues and civil liberties/discrimination among various minority groups. The Statue of Liberty played a two-fold purpose: for the more literal theatre-goer, it signified the setting of New York City. Its primary purpose, however, was to evoke the question "Has Lady Liberty turned her back on (some of) her people?" Thus, the final drop (drop E, stage left/house right) shows the Statue from behind. This is shown more literally in the canvas banner which shows a protest sign saying, "No Human Being is Illegal," which is seen on stage as liter leading into a trashcan (although in the concept elevations, it was facing for the step ladders).</p><p>After the backdrops were decided upon, it was determined that I would also serve as production graphic designer. The production logo was the next piece to complete. The original logo with the dancers on scaffolding and stencilized type is so iconic, but not fitting for this production. I kept the stenciling, but updated it with a more "grunge" outline and a view of the statue. The canvas "trash" drop became a violator on the posters and the front cover of the program because of how thoroughly the image summed up the visual concept of inequality under the eye of the Statue.</p><p>It was, as always, a pleasure to work with the St. Andrew's community on this production. The talent of some of the performers even surpasses professionals who have been in the business for years. That talent is matched only by their gratitude, sincerity, and professionalism. The show was absolutely fantastic. I wish them all the best as they continue their production this weekend. Have good shows!</p><p>Go Cru!</p>
