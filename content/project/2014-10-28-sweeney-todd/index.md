The tradition continues! Following [Beauty and the Beast](/project/beauty-and-beast) and [Scarlet Pimpernel](/project/scarlet-pimpernel), I was delighted to be invited to offer graphic design services to the St. Andrew's Episcopal School fall musical, Sweeney Todd.

This year, Director Rick Garcia wanted to incorporate the collage work of recent graduate Alex Lewis as a background for the artwork, basis for the logo, and in media projections during the show. For the development of the show "logo," I photographed and altered the collage and framed it with type, but aimed to let the artwork stand on its own as much as possible as it conveys a darkness and lonliness unlike other _Sweeney Todd_ production collateral I have seen.
