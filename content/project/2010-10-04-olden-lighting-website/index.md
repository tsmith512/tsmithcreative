<p>The Olden Lighting website needed to be modernized, reorganized, and built within a CMS instead of static HTML pages. Their web presence was information-rich, but the look was dated. They wanted to update the appearance without losing their corporate identity and teal/tan color scheme. In my view, it was most critical that the new site have an easy-to-use navigation system because of the amount of information on every page in the site.</p><p>Thus, I divided the site into three branches: See, Learn, Do. Each of these had several categories of pages listed with the branches. For example, "Learn" featured a "Theatrical Lighting" category. Each category contains several pages (like "Theatrical Fixtures") which were listed in tabs at the top of the content area. Finally, each page can contain several different products (like "Ellipsoidals") which had target anchors after an introductory paragraph.</p><p>As of this posting, Olden Lighting's website project is awaiting final content edits, approval, and new photography, so it is not yet posted to their servers.</p>
