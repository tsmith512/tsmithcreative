<p>Club 209 needed a new website which could be more easily maintained and better exemplify visually its atmosphere and sophistication. I began with a location photoshoot; each photo was processed in HDR and are displayed on the website in a Polaroid-esque frame, which is intended to resonate with a crowd of an age that will remember their heyday, without alienating the youngest legal audience.</p><p>Club 209 also has very different crowds on different evenings. Photography was location-only to avoid building an expectation of a "typical" customer.</p><p>The Club 209 Website was awarded a Student ADDY Award by the Tulsa Chapter of the American Advertising Federation at&nbsp;<a title="ADDY44" href="http://www.tsmithcreative.com/archives/addy44">ADDY44</a>.</p><p>Special Fact: Two weeks after this website launched, I started working there as a bartender.</p>
