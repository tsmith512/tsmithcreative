<p>Through Third Floor, I was selected to design a postcard for The School of Art's Faculty Show. Professors submitted work, of which primarily detail views are shown. The tri-fold interoir expands to 18" which allowed me to display the work in an almost confrontational way. My goal was to contrast the breadth of the type of work being created by our faculty with a sense of unity to indicate the strength and cooperation within the department.</p><p>Awarded a Gold Medal at the 2011 OSU Creative Lightning Awards.</p>
