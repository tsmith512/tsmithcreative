<p>The Tristesse Grief Center provides free grief counseling in individual and group settings. Times of need are not restricted to those able to afford help. The Grief Center employs full-time and part-time professional therapists and counselors. ARTSCAPE is one of their primary annual fundraisers and, along with other efforts this year, has successfully allowed them to move to a larger space and bring on an additional full-time staff member.</p><p>Susan Bramsch, current President of the Tulsa Chapter of the American Advertising Federation, asked me to produce invitations and programs for this event using the previous year's logo but using a distinctly new feel which included as much of the donated artwork as possible.</p>
