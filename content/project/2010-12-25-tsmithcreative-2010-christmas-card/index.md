<p>A little thank you to my family, friends, and partners in crime who helped make 2010 such a wonderful year.</p><p>The card uses a rather disturbing photo taken during my first ever ice storm. Being from the wonderful land of Austin, Texas, I thoroughly believed that ice is something that never covers more than one's windshield and snow always disappears by noon. As they say, ignorance is bliss; God bless Texas.</p><p>But this card, sent out during my senior year of exile in the winter wonderland, signals a great defeat of winter weather and a substantial increase of my investments in winter clothing. The photo was transformed into a hospitable (or maybe just less-threatening) scene courtesy of the magic of adjustment layers.</p><p>Merry Christmas,<br />TSmith</p>
