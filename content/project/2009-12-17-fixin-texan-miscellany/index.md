Fixin' To is a handmade book written by people from Texas, explaining a little bit about our Texas pride in response to an academic prompt to create a book on culture. It is a collection of edited short stories and thoughts ranging from crazy huge bugs to the life-long journeys of people born elsewhere now living in the Great State.

It is thirty-two pages with two folded maps held in bands on a middle spread. Covers, maps, and bands were all screenprinted by hand; text pages were printed on a Xerox Phaser 7700DN.

Awarded a Gold Medal at the 24th Annual Brass Ring Awards. Accepted to the 42nd annual Gussman Juried Student Exhibition. Displayed in the Spring of 2010 at the TU Special Collections Division at McFarlin Library.
