## Now.

A thought: why is this website here? How could I do more with it? Do other people
do this? How? What ever happened to blogs?

I recently joined the [ASMBLY Makerspace](https://asmbly.org/) in Austin. I
think I'd like to build a pair of table lamps. Bringing together a very
elementary start in woodworking with a long-standing knowledge of simple
lighting electrics and drive for cozier illumination.

_**This is a Now page.** I stumbled on [this one](https://taylor.town/now) which
led me to [that one](https://sive.rs/now), where it all started. Now a lot of
people have one, and [maybe you should, too](https://sive.rs/nowff)._
