## Now.

A thought: why is this website here? How could I do more with it? Do other people
do this? How? What ever happened to blogs?

### Reading

_[The Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy 2023](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127654222-the-best-american-science-fiction-and-fantasy-2023),_
edited by R.F. Kuang (and hand-annotated as a Christmas gift by
[Evan Griffith](https://www.evangriffithbooks.com/))

### Building

- Moving some content around on my website and changing how some of the blog
  teasers are displayed so the "blog" is a little more varied/interesting.
  _(Thanks to [Kevin Kipp](https://kevinkipp.com/) for showing me [Adam Argyle's blog](https://nerdy.dev) as inspiration.)_
- Gearing up for the [Zilker Theatre Productions](https://zilker.org) summer
  performance of _Legally Blonde,_ opening this July!

<h2 style="color: #999;">Soon?</h2>

I recently joined the [ASMBLY Makerspace](https://asmbly.org/) in Austin. Not
exactly sure what my next round of projects will be... the planter boxes I
built worked out well, but I am, as it turns out, bad at plants...

I should blog more... (post ideas: VidBin write-up, Stream feature launches,
some kind of howto)

_**This is a Now page.** I stumbled on [this one](https://taylor.town/now) which
led me to [that one](https://sive.rs/now), where it all started. Now,
a [lot of people have one](https://nownownow.com/), and
[maybe you should, too](https://sive.rs/nowff)._
