<h2 style="color: #999;">Recently,</h2>

- Read _[Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow](https://bookshop.org/p/books/tomorrow-and-tomorrow-and-tomorrow-gabrielle-zevin/17502475),_ Gabrielle Zevin
- Wrapped up the 2024 season of the
  [Southwest Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition]({{< ref "2019-04-02-southwest-ccdc" >}})
  as White Team lead, and passed on the team lead torch. I'll find new ways to
  help next season!
- Moved some ancient content around on the site to surface some old portfolio
  pieces in the blog feed --- with more variation in the list view.
  _(Thanks to [Kevin Kipp](https://kevinkipp.com/) for showing me [Adam Argyle's blog](https://nerdy.dev) as inspiration.)_

## Now.

A thought: why is this website here? How could I do more with it? Do other people
do this? How? What ever happened to blogs?

### Reading

_[The Strange Wonders of Roots](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-strange-wonders-of-roots-evan-griffith/20611594?ean=9780063287969),_
[Evan Griffith](https://www.evangriffithbooks.com/). (I got my hands on a pre-release copy!)

### Building

- Gearing up for the [Zilker Theatre Productions](https://zilker.org) summer
  performance of _Legally Blonde,_ opening this July!

<h2 style="color: #999;">Soon?</h2>

I recently joined the [ASMBLY Makerspace](https://asmbly.org/) in Austin. Not
exactly sure what my next round of projects will be... the planter boxes I
built worked out well, but I am, as it turns out, bad at plants...

I should blog more... (post ideas: VidBin write-up, Stream feature launches,
some kind of howto)

_**This is a Now page.** I stumbled on [this one](https://taylor.town/now) which
led me to [that one](https://sive.rs/now), where it all started. Now,
a [lot of people have one](https://nownownow.com/), and
[maybe you should, too](https://sive.rs/nowff)._
