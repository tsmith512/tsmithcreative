## Now.

A thought: why is this website here? How could I do more with it? Do other people
do this? How? What ever happened to blogs?

### Reading

_[The Best American Science Fiction and Fantasy 2023](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/127654222-the-best-american-science-fiction-and-fantasy-2023),_
edited by R.F. Kuang (and hand-annotated as a Christmas gift by
[Evan Griffith](https://www.evangriffithbooks.com/))

### Building

- Preparing for the 2024 season of the
  [Southwest Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition]({{< ref "2019-04-02-southwest-ccdc" >}})
  as White Team lead. _(âœ… Qualifiers done! Onto Regionals.)_
- Moving some content around on my website and changing how some of the blog
  teasers are displayed so the "blog" is a little more varied/interesting.
  _(Thanks to [Kevin Kipp](https://kevinkipp.com/) for showing me [Adam Argyle's blog](https://nerdy.dev) as inspiration.)_

<h2 style="color: #999;">Soon?</h2>

Hanging window blinds.

I recently joined the [ASMBLY Makerspace](https://asmbly.org/) in Austin. I
think I'd like to build a pair of table lamps. Bringing together a very
elementary start in woodworking with a long-standing knowledge of simple
lighting electrics and drive for cozier illumination.

_**This is a Now page.** I stumbled on [this one](https://taylor.town/now) which
led me to [that one](https://sive.rs/now), where it all started. Now,
a [lot of people have one](https://nownownow.com/), and
[maybe you should, too](https://sive.rs/nowff)._
