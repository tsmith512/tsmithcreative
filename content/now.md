## Now.

A thought: why is this website here? How could I do more with it? Do other people
do this? How? What ever happened to blogs?

### Reading

[Borne](https://bookshop.org/p/books/borne-jeff-vandermeer/15879530?ean=9780374537654), Jeff Vandermeer. Birthday gift from Evan!

### Building

Apparently, getting into [entry-level ESP32 projects]({{< ref 2024-09-10-esp32-leak-detector>}})
and wondering what comes next.

Prototyping and documenting some research onto how we might add multilingual
support on our new [Automated Captions](https://blog.cloudflare.com/stream-automatic-captions-with-ai)
feature.

Stuck on the design work for panels I want to laser cut to build a lightbox in
an old bookshelf. But I recently had a breakthrough on the concept.

_**This is a Now page.** I stumbled on [this one](https://taylor.town/now) which
led me to [that one](https://sive.rs/now), where it all started. Now,
a [lot of people have one](https://nownownow.com/), and
[maybe you should, too](https://sive.rs/nowff)._
