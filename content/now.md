## Now.

A thought: why is this website here? How could I do more with it? Do other people
do this? How? What ever happened to blogs?

### Reading

- [Agony Hill](https://bookshop.org/p/books/agony-hill-a-mystery-sarah-stewart-taylor/20390022),
  Sarah Stewart Taylor. I met Sarah and picked up my copy at the inaugural
  [New Hampshire Book Festival](https://www.nhbookfestival.org/)

  as my next professional development read

### Building

A fairly last-minute Halloween costume that will involve very minor 3D printing
and wiring.

I completed the design for the laser cut panels and have half-installed them into

Prototyping and documenting some research onto how we might add multilingual
support on our new [Automated Captions](https://blog.cloudflare.com/stream-automatic-captions-with-ai)
feature.

_**This is a Now page.** I stumbled on [this one](https://taylor.town/now) which
led me to [that one](https://sive.rs/now), where it all started. Now,
a [lot of people have one](https://nownownow.com/), and
[maybe you should, too](https://sive.rs/nowff)._
