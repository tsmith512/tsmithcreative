<h2 style="color: #999;">Recently,</h2>

- Read _[The Strange Wonders of Roots](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-strange-wonders-of-roots-evan-griffith/20611594?ean=9780063287969),_
  [Evan Griffith](https://www.evangriffithbooks.com/) ðŸ’™
- Finally finished Melissa Perri's _[Escaping the Build Trap](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/escaping-the-build/9781491973783/)_
  which is maybe the first professional development book I've read cover-to-cover
  and it took me a year to do it. I need to figure out how to work more of this
  into my regular habits.

## Now.

A thought: why is this website here? How could I do more with it? Do other people
do this? How? What ever happened to blogs?

### Reading

### Building

<h2 style="color: #999;">Soon?</h2>

I recently joined the [ASMBLY Makerspace](https://asmbly.org/) in Austin. Not
exactly sure what my next round of projects will be... the planter boxes I
built worked out well, but I am, as it turns out, bad at plants...

_**This is a Now page.** I stumbled on [this one](https://taylor.town/now) which
led me to [that one](https://sive.rs/now), where it all started. Now,
a [lot of people have one](https://nownownow.com/), and
[maybe you should, too](https://sive.rs/nowff)._
