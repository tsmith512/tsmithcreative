      I'm a product manager with a design and engineering background. I
      bring cross-functional teams together to tackle complex challenges and
      develop tools to empower users. But as a tinkerer at heart, I am most
      passionate about opportunities to dive deep into users' interests and
      underlying technology to see how it all works together. I love to learn,
      teach, write code, build things, and puzzle with smart people.
      Currently, I serve the Stream Live and Video-on-Demand team at
      <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-stream/">Cloudflare</a>.
