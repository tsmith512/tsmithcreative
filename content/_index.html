      As a Technical Product Manager, I lead teams who turn opportunities into
      tools that empower people. With a design education and engineering
      background, I bring cross-functional teams together to tackle complex
      challenges, develop tools to connect clients to their audiences, migrate
      legacy systems, and work more efficiently. But as a tinkerer at heart, I
      am most passionate about opportunities that let me dive deep into the
      underlying technology to understand how and why it all works. I love to
      learn, teach, write code, make art, and puzzle on big challenges with
      smart people. Currently, I lead the Marketing Engineering team at
