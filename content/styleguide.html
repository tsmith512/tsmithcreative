    <strong>Space&hellip;</strong> the <em>final frontier.</em> These are
    the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its continuing mission: to
    explore <a href="#">strange new worlds</a>; to seek out new life and
    new civilizations; to boldly go where no one has gone before.

      At 0800 hours, station time, the Romulan Empire formally declared
      war against the Dominion. They've already struck fifteen bases along
      the Cardassian border. So, this is a huge victory for the good guys!
      This may even be the turning point of the entire war! There's even a
      <em>"Welcome to the Fight"</em> party tonight in the wardroom!
    </p>
    <p>
      So&hellip; I lied. I cheated. I bribed men to cover up the crimes of
      other men. I am an accessory to murder. But most damning of all&hellip;
      I think I can live with it. And if I had to do it all over again&hellip;
      I would. Garak was right about one thing: a guilty conscience is a
      small price to pay for the safety of the Alpha Quadrant. So I will
      learn to live with it. Because I can live with it...
    </p>
    <p>
      I can live with it.

    It was the dawn of the third age of mankind &mdash; ten years after
    the Earth-Minbari War. The Babylon Project was a dream, given form. Its
    goal: to prevent another war, by creating a place where humans and
    aliens can work out their differences peacefully. It's a port of call
    &mdash; home away from home &mdash; for diplomats, hustlers,
    entrepreneurs, and wanderers.

    Humans and aliens, wrapped in two million, five hundred thousand tons
    of spinning metal &mdash; all alone in the night. It can be a dangerous
    place, but it's our last best hope for peace.

    This is the story of the last of the Babylon stations. The year is
    2258. <em>The name of the place is Babylon 5.</em>
