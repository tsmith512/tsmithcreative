_“Wait, you work from home? That must be \_\_\_\_\_\_.”_ People follow that with
words like: _terrible_, _distracting_, _isolating_, _lonely_, and occasionally
_“awesome because you don’t have to wear pants!”_

When I started at Four Kitchens in 2012, everyone worked in the office. Working
from home, even for a few hours, would necessitate an office-wide “WFH” email.
Calling-in for meetings meant being the lone voice on the Polycom who could
neither hear well nor contribute meaningfully to the discussion. Missing
in-person conversations meant working in isolation.

## From Telecommuting to Distributed Working

The transition from isolated telecommuting to a distributed culture began as we
hired two engineers out of state and I made a short-term move to Tulsa for a
change of scenery. Initially, the isolation I felt working from home was more
difficult than I had anticipated. The cabin fever was worse because I was living
and working from a 200ft2 garage apartment. On the company end, we weren’t
nurturing our remote workers very well and there were times we three felt
forgotten about.

To address that, we had to grow our communications strategy beyond “WFH.” We
moved most conversations to chat programs ([HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com)
then [Slack](https://slack.com/)) and video calls
([Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/) then [Zoom Meetings](http://zoom.us/)),
prioritizing tools that decreased barriers to opening conversation, making it
easier to be out of the office
([just type “/zoom” in a Slack room!](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/205153255-Setting-Up-Slack-Integration)).
Our in-office colleagues began joining video calls from their desks, putting
everyone on an equal ground no matter where they were working from. Soon, every
project and operations team had at least one remote member, ensuring that these
techniques were applied company-wide. Increasingly, with growing comfort in a
distributed workflow, local employees began to work from home on a regular basis
which has culminated in the closing of our Austin office.

Traditionally, considering jobs means considering location. Prioritize the job
and move across town or across the country to get there. Or prioritize the
location and look for work in the area. But sometimes life simply necessitates a
move for other reasons, and that can mean having to find a new job whether you
want to or not. Being on a distributed team allows us to not only pick the best
of both (where we live and where we work), but the freedom to roam. I can work
anywhere I need or want to be. While that freedom is nice, it also means that
we’ll have to look elsewhere for the the automatic professional and social
networking that comes along with a physical office, so there is a trade-off.

## Staying Connected

Unlike the lone team member working from home, collectively working as a
distributed team is a shared experience. I’m not a floating voice like The Ghost
of Conference Phone; I’m part of a team of people who are communicating
effectively, equally, and empathetically.

Though some developers prefer to work in solitude, I’m still a “people
person”—many of us are. Four Kitchens’ culture is strong enough to transcend
geography, but we remain close as a team because we do prioritize high quality
in-person time. We host annual retreats for the whole team. Through our
professional development program, we offer conference travel opportunities which
usually involve delegations of multiple Web Chefs. We also pitch and kick-off
new work by sending project teams to meet with clients in-person. We’ve even
crossed paths on vacation!

And because we don’t see each other in the office, I organize regular social
gatherings for the Austin-based team members as well. It’s important to
recognize that many people on the Four Kitchens team relocated (or at least made
residential choices) based around this physical space we shared at 3415
Greystone Drive. We’ve built a good culture of nurturing our distributed
workforce, but nurturing the distributed team members who all live in the same
city has its own kind of considerations.

## What’s Next?

This change has not happened without its fair share of growing pains, but I have
come to realize that telecommuting is not the same as working on a distributed
team. Being distributed requires paying specific attention to fostering personal
relationships. It takes more care than just throwing a bunch of people in an
open office bullpen, but the strength of the community is derived from the very
expenditure of that effort. Closing the office seems like the end of this journey,
but in truth it is the final “levelling up” in our collective responsibility to
prevent anyone on the team from feeling isolated. I’m excited about the
possibilities that becoming fully distributed will afford us, but I’m probably
still going to wear pants.
