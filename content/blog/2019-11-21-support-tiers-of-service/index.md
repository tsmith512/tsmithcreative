title: "Streamlining Support Services"
summary: "A plan to streamline operations and significantly reduce overhead for Support and Continuous Improvement services."
tags: [case study, product management, process improvement]
problem: >
  Helping a Support Department operating with inconsistent contracts that cause
  significant unbillable overhead and management challenges as each of ~40
  accounts operated differently. Consulting the team, its project managers,
  business development, and company leadership, I drafted a new approach to
  simplify and streamline.

Four Kitchens offers ongoing support services to clients. As the department
grew, there was significant variability across contracts, leading to different
terms for each of ~50 concurrent accounts: retainers vs. bill-as-used, monthly
vs. quarterly vs. annually, variable rollover allowances, and expiration
periods. This presented uncertainties in monthly capacity planning, high
unbillable overhead, inefficiencies in billing, and difficulties for reporting.

## Summarized Findings

In an effort to standardize our offerings, I discovered several opportunities:

- Business Development _wanted_ input to sell more consistent, packaged
  agreements.
- Project management (billable) and account management (unbillable) time were
  disproportionately higher for smaller accounts and the former ate into
  retainer hours.
- On a time-and-materials basis, new automation tools slashed potential revenue
  per account but increased effective capacity for new accounts.
- Company's target market strongly prefers quarterly agreements to monthly
  agreements. Flexibility to offer a quarterly contract would be a compelling
  differentiator.

## New Tiers of Service

I recommended transitioning clients over to one of three different "plans" over
the next 6-12 months.

### Security Update Coverage: Keep your site on cruise control, rest easy.

A lower tier of service leveraging value-based, flat-rate billing for a
partially automated level of service. For a client, this is insurance: a safety
net during a time of transition and/or a consistent cost for a needed service.
It also sets a lower expectation on touch-points for account and project
management.

**One client explained to me** that her tendency to plan out hourly expenditures
meticulously was due to the fear she would come up short if an urgent security
release came out and she would be held responsible for an incident. Between this
insight and the upcoming update automation, I decided to split security update
coverage out of the hourly billing component of all support tiers. This first
tier would be flat-rate completely and cover security updates automatically.

For the business, this provides cost splitting across accounts to grow a suite
of automation and monitoring tools as well as R&D initiatives that allow
additional capacity. Value-based billing realizes more revenue than hourly
billing _most months,_ building up reserves for high-labor months like major
security incidents or another "Drupalgeddon."

### Security Updates and Support: Stay safe and exterminate bugs.

A medium tier of service offering a modest quarterly retainer of hours focused
on bugfixes and low-burn improvements. It offloads security updates as described
above to a discounted rider and project management to an established overhead
percentage. Clients are offered additional touch-points with the team and direct
access to tools to maintain their backlog of work.

For the client, this offers a predictable level of ongoing support attention in
addition to the assurances of security monitoring and updates. They also feel
more connected to the team.

For the business, this is essentially the MVP offering for "continuous
improvement." It offloads the need to account for project management and
security updates within the retainer hours and offers a marketable package.


### Security Updates and Continuous Improvement: Evolve your site while keeping it safe.

A further expansion with a deeper discount on security update coverage in
exchange for a significant retainer commitment. Additions include touch-points
to the team, tool access, and other offerings to build a premium, highly
collaborative experience.

For the client, this should feel like "our team is your team." For the business,
these are the main revenue drivers with the most busienss development potential,
this offering is geared toward treating them as such, including additional
opportunities to propose additional services or audits.

## Results

The company rolled these plans out in 2020H1 and successfully converted about
50% of their existing contracts to the new plans. Even before that, however,
this structure allowed the department to adjust its qualifications process for
new contracts and renewals.
