# Preshow

Rick Garcia joined [St. Andrew's](https://www.sasaustin.org/) Upper School as
the new theatre director the same year I started as a student. From a certain
point of view, that theatre department started this journey. In the Tech Theatre
class, I moved around from set construction to electrical work (which I did
professionally) to
[photographing shows](https://tsmithphotos.com/theatre?utm_source=tsmithcreative&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=blog)
and into stage management (which I still do). Also: when I was a junior, our
"Photoshop person" graduated. I'd used Photoshop for years. Could I whip up a
poster?

## Company (2005), or "Graphic Design: The Overture"

Thankfully, he gave me an achievable mission on my first graphic design
adventure for _Company._ Rick distills his concept for a show into a sentence or
visual that he calls "the commanding image." The commanding image was "a city of
strangers," best explained in the lyrics of the song
_[Another Hundred People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07bgbi_gO2U)._ Rick
handed me a copy of _Vanity Fair,_ pointed to the cover, and said, "Make _this,_
but with _this_ photo" that an art student took of the lead actor.

_Kindly ignore_ the gratuitous drop shadows and _stretched_ type. 2005 was a
lot of learnin' ago.

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="2005-Company.jpg" alt="Company poster"  >}}

After designing pieces for each subsequent show, I decided to attend The
University of Tulsa for graphic design. Rick became one of my first freelance
clients while I was still a student.

# My First Ten Year Account

At 2019's "Meet the Production Staff" Parents' Night, two things happened.
Peggy, our Production Manager, pointed out that it was my tenth show as a
guest artist. Also, a parent I hadn't met yet asked me
_who my child was in the show._ Apparently, I should sleep more.

In 2021, my first post-Covid theatre engagement was the delayed 2020 production
of _Evita._ It was also my eleventh show as an alumni guest artist --- and as it
turned out, Rick's final production before retiring from St. Andrew's faculty.

Upon hearing _that_ news, I took a stroll through the archives. (And finally
finished this draft I started forever ago.) Like _Company,_ sometimes Rick
approached me with a strong visual concept to refine. Other years, he turned me
loose with abstract ideas to see where I'd run on my own. That mirrored a lot of
Rick's work with his other students: a combination of specific challenges and
broad creative freedom. Either way, there is a lot of both of us in each.

## West Side Story (2010)

I was a junior at TU when Rick brought me back. Primarily, he wanted a set of
backdrops and textiles for use onstage. Then we worked backward, using those to
create the poster and other pieces. I even took these to a few class critiques.
Commanding image: "Lady Liberty has turned her back on her people."

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="2010-WSS-Poster.jpg" alt="West Side Story poster"  >}}

We ordered the backdrops printed at Lamar Outdoor Advertising (the billboard
people) in Tulsa.

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="2010-WSS-Backdrops-1.jpg" alt="West Side Story scenery"  >}}

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="2010-WSS-Backdrops-2.jpg" alt="West Side Story scenery"  >}}

Lamar found it entertaining because it's a departure from their usual
_everything._ "They're... vertical! And indoors?" Their team got excited about
how to adjust the process to produce a good drop.

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="2010-WSS-Performance.jpg" alt="West Side Story preshow photo"  >}}

Short of a print job I once ordered that called for a _full truckload_ of paper,
this remains the largest physical piece I have designed.

## Chorus Line (2011)

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="2011-CL.jpg" alt="Chorus Line poster"  >}}

Of all of them, this may be my favorite show wordmark. Simple is good. Peggy did
a photoshoot of the cast in-character, which personalized the poster and gave
them an exciting sense of ownership.

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="2011-CL-logo.png" alt="Chorus Line logo"  >}}

_A Chorus Line_ has such an individual focus, contrasting the plot's premise
"these are all interchangeable potential cast members, we just need to pick
one." Characters build relationships with the audience through individual scenes
or small vignettes as they all audition for the same role in an upcoming show.
All the while, the impersonal casting director cuts more and more of them until
only one --- [one singular sensation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyZeGOsR9IA) --- remains.

## Scarlet Pimpernel (2012)

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="2012-SP.jpg" alt="Scarlet Pimpernel poster"  >}}

Wherein typography and patterns lean heavily into the _flourish_ of the story of
a British fop who, alongside his secret society of unassuming dandies, rescued
French aristocrats from the Reign of Terror. The background pattern is a
silkscreen my [printmaking professor](http://www.michellemartinprintmaker.com/)
was working on.

## Beauty and the Beast (2013)

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="2013-BATB.png" alt="Beauty and the Beast poster"  >}}

The background is made from photos I took of the set designer's paper models. I
love how _that_ and the wordmark turned out, creating a darker atmosphere than
usual _Beauty_ designs. In retrospect, the rose feels out of place, or at least
not stylistically consistent.

Rick and I usually steer clear of the common elements people associate with
shows so we can make it our own, but we also have to get the point across
quickly. The rose is _the thing_ most people associate with this show's
publicity materials, so we kept it that time.

## Sweeny Todd (2014)

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="2014-SW-Poster.jpg" alt="Sweeney Todd poster"  >}}

Rick worked with art student Alex L. to create this collage, and the three of us
collaborated on incorporating his artwork into our publicity designs.
Opportunities to work directly with the students weren't always possible, but it
was always rewarding when we could.

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="2014-SW-Art.jpg" alt="Original collage art"  >}}

## Les Miserables (2015)

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="2015-LM.jpg" alt="Les Mis poster"  >}}

This was the first photoshoot I did myself of a student in-costume and it was
fun! The background is a merge of four photos to create the environment. Despite
what now feels like over-processing, there's a lot I like here, but:

_Rick, you know what you made me do on this poster and I'm still mad about it._ ðŸ˜‰

## Legally Blonde (2016)

Commanding image: "Is justice really blind?" And can she look like a
stereotypical California beach blonde?

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="2016-LB.jpg" alt="Legally Blonde poster"  >}}

A fun yet _stark_ departure from my usual aesthetic. I'm pleased with the
colors, typography, and how I learned to love polka dots. But the primary visual
is proof that I was right all along: I cannot draw my way out of a box.
Thankfully, iStockPhoto has an entire section of illustrations which I am
apparently not too ashamed to mash together.

## Catch Me If You Can (2017)

Rick's commanding image was something along the lines of "the limelight he
chases is also the target on his back," with the specific requirement to include
a target or bullseye prominently in the visual.

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="2017-CMIYC-Poster.jpg" alt="Catch Me If You Can Poster"  >}}

I _loved_ working on that wordmark. The arrow motif was used in the movie
collateral, too, but less integrated and with a very different aesthetic. I took
the arrow edges to form the pilot's wings on the poster. Then I
[3D printed]({{< ref "2018-01-11-3d-printing-2017" >}}) that illustration for
Celia, our costume designer, to use on the uniform:

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="/assets/blog/3d-printing-2017/wings-model.png" alt="Wings Model in Fustion 360"  >}}

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="/assets/blog/3d-printing-2017/delta.jpg" alt="Bulk printing on a delta"  >}}

As it turns out, authentic PanAm wings are both frightfully expensive and too
small for the stage. This pin was huge up close, but it read well at a distance.

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="/assets/blog/3d-printing-2017/wings.jpg" alt="3D printed wings for costuming"  >}}

## Jesus Christ Superstar (2018)

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="2018-JCSS.jpg" alt="Jesus Christ Superstar poster"  >}}

According to the grungy commanding image of this production (and, for that
matter, a valid scriptural interpretation), Jesus was a protester. The artwork
needed to evoke a street protest or underground movement. This background image
was an experiment; everything else I showed was a forward view of a street,
rusty warehouse, or protest footage. But he loved the idea of looking up, from
the poverty to the glass, juxtaposing two ideas: the ruling class looking down
on Jesus and his followers (a central motif of the scenic design) and God being
the higher power to reach toward.

## Spring Awakening (2019)

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="2019-SA.jpg" alt="Spring Awakening poster"  >}}

The _Spring Awakening_ visual concept came from a piece of surrealist art Rick
found during his initial research. I really wish we'd been able to stage a
photoshoot for this one.

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="/assets/blog/audence-awakening/voting-in-rehearsal.jpg" alt="Audience member voting with the audience participation app"  >}}

Rick also wanted to add an audience participation element into this show, which
evolved into us [building a web application]({{< ref "2019-10-25-the-audience-awakening" >}})
together.

## Evita (2021)

We debated using a photo of Eva PerÃ³n for this but didn't find one we liked.
And the production had multiple actors playing Che, partly to reinforce the
concept of Che as an everyman --- the population of Argentina trying to judge
Evita's legacy. We wanted Che(s) to be _in_ the photo to show that tension. And
this get-together represented the start of a long climb out of the pandemic
toward getting back on stage. I remember driving home _elated._

{{< media type="image" size="mini" src="2021-Evita.jpg" alt="Evita poster"  >}}

I did this as a socially-distanced photoshoot across the full width of the PAC
stage looking out toward a house wall. Our focus was the fog _around_ Evita. It
was as much artistic intent as socially-distanced low-light optics that the
Che's were visible but out of focus. The poster is _about_ the populace's
judgemental, pensive inquisition of her sharp, perfected expression.

Rick wanted the trio to "burst through" the
[Argentinian flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Argentina), but I
talked him into the blue washes along the top and bottom with a color scheme
derived from the national colors of Argentina instead.

# Curtain Call

Along the way, I graduated with a BFA in Graphic Design and meandered my way
professionally through being a production artist, web designer, full-stack
engineer for Drupal and WordPress, product owner, and now product manager and PM
coach. Each of these roles benefits from design thinking, a stage manager's
capacity for orchestration, roadmapping action items from ~~Rick's wild~~
_abstract_ ideas, and the speaking experience of having even been cast in a show
or two. (I'd like to think I killed it as the narrating "Laundress #2"
in _Metamorphoses._) And I still take on a couple shows each year on the side.

This annual tradition of joining a big team of artists in service to a grand
production vision has always been as much a privilege and recharge as it is a
feat. At each of the _Parents' Night_ events, Rick tells his students' parents
about how theatre education has applications well beyond the stage. Being
neither an educator nor a parent, my usual job is to tell an abbreviated version
of this story to assuage nervous parents who, like my own once did, worry about
the academic impact of too much time spent "in the space." It's decidedly a lot,
but who knows what all it might ignite.
