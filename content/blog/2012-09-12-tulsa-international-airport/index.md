<p>The Tulsa International Airport approached Walsh for a total rebranding effort including a new website that must be mobile-friendly. Their existing site was developed within a capable but proprietary CMS that made heavy usage of Adobe Flash and the "mobile site" was a distinct site with a separate content base that required double-entry. Along with a custom responsive theme, I developed plugins:</p><ul><li>To download, parse, and display flight information with jQuery-powered client-side filtering and searching;</li><li>To collect map "layers" as a Custom Post Type which can be displayed on their own pages with the associated base layer or as part of an AJAX-powered Map Display which features layer groups;</li><li>To add custom widgets for a better recent posts display, a text/image widget (powered by <a href="http://mondaybynoon.com/" target="_blank">Jonathan Christopher's</a> <a href="http://mondaybynoon.com/wordpress/widget-image-field/">Widget Image Field</a>), and the flight information as a widget; and finally</li><li>To add an admin "Site Resources" tab with samples and templates for asset images, optimal image dimensions, and notes/reminders for ongoing maintenance.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
