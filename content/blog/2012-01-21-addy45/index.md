<p>I served as Co-Chair <a href="/project/addy44">again</a> this year, as AAF Tulsa celebrated its 75th Anniversary this year with the 45th annual ADDY Awards. To celebrate, the awards banquet was held at the original ADDY location: The Crystal Ballroom at The Mayo Hotel. The Winners Book was an extra treat with a massive history of the club and the industry in Tulsa and the surrounding region, bringing the page count to 108. Congratulations to all the winners and a big thanks to the whole Tulsa community for supporting us for all these years!</p>
