<p>In the words of a good friend: This makes it real.</p>

<p>Rather than the standard announcements produced by the school's contractor, I opted for something I could use as a mini-portfolio piece and website referral tool. The announcement is also intended to match the new design of my website, resume, and business cards as I start looking for new ways to keep boredom and sleeping at bay. I attempted to show two pieces of each of my areas of focus: photography, book design, print design, and theatrical lighting.</p><p>Work featured on the card:</p><ul><li>The <a href="/gallery/photography">BOK Center and Bayless Night</a> photos from the <a href="/project/addy44">ADDY44 Winners Book</a></li><li><a href="/project/west-side-story">West Side Story</a> backdrop design</li><li><a href="/project/2010-texas-commencement">University of Texas Commencement</a> (which serves the two-fold purpose as portfolio credit and acknowledgement of my Longhorn roots)</li><li><a href="/project/nsac-2010">NSAC 2010 Plansbook</a></li><li><a href="/project/addy44">ADDY44 Winners Book</a></li><li><a href="/project/visual-thinking-faculty-show-2010">Visual Thinking</a> Tri-fold Invitation</li><li><a href="/project/west-side-story">West Side Story</a> Poster</li></ul><p>The copy reads: "If it all goes according to the master plan / The University of Tulsa / might actually graduate / Taylor Smith / Bachelor of Fine Arts / Graphic Design / and let him take a nap after the ceremony at / Nine O'Clock on May 7th, 2011 / in the Reynolds Center."</p>
