Every year, The University of Tulsa participates in the American Advertising Federation's [National Student Advertising Competition](http://www.aaf.org/default.asp?id=122). Participant schools prepare a campaign for that year's sponsor, generally to increase brand awareness and market penetration among a college/18-24 demographic (though to match State Farm's insurance brackets, this campaign specifies a target market of 18-25 year-olds). This year's sponsor was State Farm.

Through extensive research and sleepless nights, our team developed our concept: The Cool Old Guy. Given that State Farm is well-known in the 18-24 demographic to be "old as dirt," we knew that we had to embrace that; there was simply no way to convincingly make State Farm "young." Moreover, we discovered that we shouldn't try to reboot the company. Through our research, we learned that when these young adults need help (claims situations, for example), they don't want something hip and trendy like the Gecko (GEICO), Flo (Progressive), Justin Case (SafeAuto), the Superhero (esurance), or even "That Guy from 24" (Allstate). They wanted someone reliable and trustworthy. If "old" means "knowledgeable and experienced" instead of "out-of-touch," then it's a winner. "There's nothing wrong with being old if you're the best at what you do."

As Creative Director for the campaign, I supervised all graphic design efforts and handled personally the layout and compilation of the plansbook. Mock-ups of several of the executions were handled by my talented graphics team: Amanda Morton and Justin Hobbs. Copy was written by our many writers and researchers. Video stills (and the fully produced commercials, of which there were SIX!) and the iPhone Age Progression App were executed by the Production team, lead by Rob Nickels. At the competition, the plansbook received the "Judges' Choice" award.

When concepting the book, inspiration came from the basics of our campaign. In a simplified way, our campaign highlighted the positive of age. Also, the campaign was very personal. As such, the book was designed to emphasize the character of the Cool Old Guy and appear traditional, approachable, and inviting without looking out of touch or unappealing to both the Target Market and the Client. It was important to have characteristics of a professional business proposal (at the end of the day, this was a proposal for a $40 million investment for State Farm), but without seeming overly commercial or dry. I also thought a lot about my own "Cool Old Guys." (The home of my Cool Old Theatre Director is the background on page 2.)

Great thanks go to our fantastic advisors Bill Hinkle (advertising and communications) and Teresa Valero (graphic design); and every single member of the team; Carla Hammer of Clampitt Papers; Nancy, Cindy, and Bill from ResourceOne; and at least a hundred other people. My personal thanks go out to those people who helped kept me sane and well-caffeinated as we approached the printing deadline (you know who you are).

The Plansbook was awarded a Student Gold ADDY at the 44th Tulsa ADDYs in February 2010 and the 10th District ADDYs in April.
