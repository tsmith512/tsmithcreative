Cloudflare sponsored [THAT Conference Texas 2024](https://thatconference.com/tx/2024/)
which gave me an opportunity to talk about Stream. As I was working with the event
team to figure out how we might demo the product, we thought about a potential
proof of concept app. I settled on making a "[PasteBin](https://pastebin.com/)"
but for video.

{{< media size="small" type="image" src="how-might-that-work.jpg" alt="Pieces of VidBin" >}}

In this presetation, I walk through Stream at a high level, then break down
VidBin into six "steps" to show common use-cases, questions, and patterns we see
as folks start building video into their app.

The app (frontend and server components both) are built with Cloudflare Pages's
new support for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) called [Next on Pages](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages).

Check out [VidBin](https://tsmith.vidbin.com) to take it for a spin or see how
it's built at [github.com/tsmith512/vidbin](https://github.com/tsmith512/vidbin).

My first stab at a new talk. Will re-record with a lot more sleep, much less
coffee, and some refinements based on the experience today!

## Acknowledgements

VidBin was heavily influenced by an internal demo called "Paste.Video" built by
two colleagues, [Ryan Schachte](https://ryan-schachte.com/) and Scott Miller,
with beta testing and frontend advice from [Kevin Kipp](https://kevinkipp.com/).
Apal Shah's post [WebRTC â€” Switch Cameras using Javascript getUserMedia](https://www.gosink.in/webrtc-switch-cameras-using-javascript-getusermedia/)
was super helpful when I was trying to figure out how to build the flip camera
button.

Thanks also to THAT Conference; [Evan Griffith](https://www.evangriffithbooks.com/)
for photos, moral support, and beta testing; and to our Cloudflare group at the
conference (Dawn, Sabrina, Peter, Nathan, Kristian, and Emilio) for a great
couple days with lots of good conversations. And in spirit, thanks to my old
friends in green at [Four Kitchens](https://www.fourkitchens.com/) who got me
speaking a lot back in the day. Today was my first talk since
[DrupalCon 2019]({{< ref "2019-04-18-dc-seattle">}}) --- and although I am on
team orange now, I was a Web Chef when I learned I like hosting talks.
