  I finally found what I've been looking for in a notes and writing app. Bonus:
  it comes with surprisingly robust project management features!

Recently, _The Verge_ ran an article about a product called [Notion][N],
"[Notion brings its powerful note-taking app to Android][VERGE]" and the preview
image caught my eye. You see:

- I've used [OneNote][ON] since 2004. I love it, but while I appreciate the
  "notebook" hierarchy, freeform pages, and handwriting, sometimes it can be
  too unstructured.
- I find [Evernote][EV]'s simultaneous feature bloat and limitations on content
  off-putting.
- [Google Keep][GK] is a great bulletin board, but it isn't an organizational
  solution for a large volume of interrelated content.

Verge _post.)_

No note taking app I'd tried felt right _for me_ because I need help organizing
and making progress, not just archiving. I've used [Todoist][T] for _years_ and
it mostly fills the gap. I love it and it's great for _tasks_, but "projects"
are just groups of tasks; there's no space for reference.

## [Notion][N] is different

More flexible content than Evernote, more structured than OneNote, more featured
than Keep, more reference-oriented than Todoist, and — thanks to a flexible
content model it calls "databases" — it can throw pages on a Kanban board,
Calendar, or Table!

## Awesome features

**Pages are built with blocks:** plain text, bullet lists, checkbox/to-do lists,
headers, images, links with previews, embeds, etc&hellip;

{{< media type="image" src="blocks.gif" alt="Blocks options for new content" >}}

**Text formatting is flexible enough, but still structured.** It's not a "full
WYSIWYG" editor like OneNote. I like that! Giving me the tools to express ideas
without turning editing into a free-for-all helps me feel like I'm making
progress instead of making a mess. Hotkeys and Markdown-style make it faster.

**Pages can have "databases"** which can be viewed as a table, Kanban board, or
calendar. "Rows" in these databases are themselves pages, but inherit a
customizable data model allowing you to add properties to visualize on
the table/board/calendar displays.

**Content can be put into columns.** Notion's ability to group content with
columns helps keep bits of text and reference material logically grouped. (In
truth, OneNote does do columns — you can put text frames next to each other —
but it can get messy.)

**Lightweight interface.** Despite all it can do, its interface is sparse and
content-focused, reducing distractions.

**Android app!** A must have. The Android app makes accessing all this
delightfully easy, and content is displayed responsively! Unlike OneNote, where
pages with more than a single text frame become pinch-to-zoom adventures.

**Sharing pages is easy.** You can get a public link for any page and its
descendants so that guests can read or comment. That's great for small projects
because it means contacts won't have to create an account.

## How I used [Notion][N] this week

**Planning travel:** By creating a "database" page, I can see upcoming trips
both in a table and on a calendar. Each trip is both a "row" in the database and
also a page on its own with all the details.

**Researching:** I gathered design research for a theatrical production this
fall, then I reviewed it with the director.

**Project management:** For that same production, I'll be creating multiple
pieces. Using another "database" page, I listed each piece needed. I set up all
three view styles for the database:
- a table for an overview of all pieces,
- a Kanban board so my director and I can track progress as I work, and
- a calendar to visualize the review and delivery dates.

**Simple writing:** I drafted this blog post in Notion. With its easy export to
Markdown, I'll be able to drop it right into my site repo.

_(Update: Worked perfectly except that images were not included in the export. Fixed them manually.)_

## What Notion is Not

**A "todo list" application** like Todoist. Though Notion may take issue with
this stance because it can be used to _make_ to-do lists.
- At their cores, Todoist is a set of _dated tasks_ while Notion is a set of
  _pages_ (or collection of databases) that you can _write dates on_. Within a
  database or on a page, you _can_ make a to-do list, but:
- Notion doesn't have a way to show you a list of "dated items" across an
  entire notebook.
- Notion does have a way to set a reminder by adding a date/time inline on a
  page, but that's not a replacement for time- or location-based reminders in
  Todoist offers for specific tasks.

**A platform with integrations.** Notion offers several importers from other
systems, but there isn't (yet?) a collection of inbound/outbound integrations
like ON/EN/TD have. I would love to see a bulk PDF export, a more organized
Markdown archive (currently, it's a flat directory with hash-prefixed names), or
maybe an "Email to Notion" importer. Also, the Android app does not receive
"Shares" from other apps; i.e. you cannot "Share" _to_ Notion from other apps.

**Tag-based.** I don't care about tags, but you might. I'm a very "put stuff in
its place and it'll be there when you get back" person: the notebook and
hierarchical, ordered page structure is _perfect_ for me. People who like
Evernote's encouraged system of "use a simpler hierarchy of date-ordered pages
and tag 'em all" may have more trouble.

**Stored locally.** Evernote/Todoist were always cloud-only; OneNote made that
switch in its latest release (to the great disappointment of many). Like the
others, Notion is offline-capable, but stored remotely. I miss local storage of
user data! <del>These data are _extremely_ valuable, so durable and usable backups
are critically important to me and I don't see any of these platforms offering a
solid safety net here. But since Notion is the youngest, I'm inclined to take a
harder look.</del>

{{< update "2020-01" >}}

Notion has always had a Markdown/CSV export option, but I have discovered that
Notion now allows HTML exports (and PDF for Enterprise users) for an entire
workspace. And the HTML looks good. With that and Markdown/CSV exports too,
Notion now offers the strongest backup tool of these options because the archive
is: locally stored, readable without the source application, an open format, and
a stable safeguard against "oops my cloud service disappeared."

I would love it if they could do some kind of automated backup but even in its
current iteration as a manual step, this solidifies Notion as a safe place for
important data for me.

## This is what I've been looking for!

I'm incredibly excited about this product. In just over a week, I've started
using [Notion][N] on a lot of projects and it seems to have a good answer to
anything I throw at it. It has many features I've been looking for in my
years-long quest to find _"the"_ notes application for me. And many I didn't
expect to find which now I can't be without. I'll absolutely still use Todoist
as a counterpart, but in combination I think I finally have a winning pair of
applications for productivity and reference.
