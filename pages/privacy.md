## Hello Hangboard

_Last Updated: 9 April 2020*_

### Privacy Policy

Hello Hangboard is a beta iOS and Android application with two focuses:
professional development exposure to React Native and to make myself use my
climbing hangboard during stay-at-home orders. I offer it freely to other
climbers who may be interested.

Hello Hangboard does not collect, use, save, or access any personal data on your
iOS or Android device. In the 1.0 series, it does not even locally store settings
or performance tracking. As such, I have no access to any user data.

Hello Hangboard is in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection
Act because it does not collect any personal information from anyone, including
children under the age of 13.

### Terms of Service

Follow the instructions that came with your exercise equipment and medical and
sports professionals. Hangboards are notorious for causing finger and tendon
injuries. They can also fall if not properly installed, leading to serious
injury. These workouts are offered in the same spirit as I received them: freely
and without warranty. Consult a trainer with climbing experience before use; I
offer no training guidance, implied or explicit &mdash; do not strain yourself
to complete a circuit.
