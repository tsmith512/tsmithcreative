I love typography and teaching clients how about typographic choices impact the legibility of materials they are producing. Most of my go-to typography references are written for designers; I had no good resource to send clients to that can educate from their perspective. [Typesetwith.me](http://typesetwith.me) allows users to see the definitions of basic terms and also manipulate the metrics to see how a passage becomes easier or harder to read. The samples include both the definitions themselves (encouraging users to have to read the text they have set) as well as a random sample of literary passages from [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/).
