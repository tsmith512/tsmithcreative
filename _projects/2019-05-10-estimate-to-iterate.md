title: "Estimating for Iteration: Story Points and Thin Vertical Slices"
summary: "A presentation on my two favorite parts of Scrum: estimating by complexity and building vertically."
tags: [product ownership, management, presentation]
portfolio: 1
problem: >
  Humans aren't great at estimating with <del>granularity at scale</del> lots of
  big stuff. And in the midst of a project, our process must be adaptable to
  change without big budget busters. Estimating by relative complexity and
  building vertically allow a team to prioritize better, be more agile, focus on
  delivering value rapidly, and iterate to improve a product.

_Thank you to the Drupal Association and DrupalCon Seattle 2019 organizers for accepting and recording this session._

At Four Kitchens, we use Scrum to manage most of our projects. In doing so,
we've learned to break down business requirements into *thin vertical slices*
of functionality, usually written as user stories. This way, teams can ensure
that planning, frontend components, backend functionality, and user
training/demos come together in sync by being worked on with a unified focus,
even as requirements fluctuate through the life of a product or client
engagement.

Estimating these "pieces of work" by using *story points* side-steps the
pitfalls of granular, hours-based estimation and equips Product Owners/Project
Managers and Stakeholders to make *informed* prioritization decisions.
Estimating is never perfect, but over time, a team will tend toward a
predictable velocity which can be used to help plan sprints or releases.

After talking about these concepts and how to put them to work in theory, we
will look at how Jira supports this method: using story points for sprint
building, using reports for longer-term planning, and how sub-tasks can help aid
a split workflow situation like component-driven design or the classic "backend
vs. frontend" argument.

These are the two concepts I introduce to all my teams and clients as projects
begin, so knowledge of Scrum or Kanban is not required! I encourage developers
and managers alike to join for this conversation because the key to a successful
project is a shared understanding of how it is structured. These techniques work
for Scrum or Kanban style agile development and are not specific to Drupal or
particular project management tools.
