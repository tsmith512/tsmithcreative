Singularity lets you toss out your old, stodgy grid system and create a system of columns and gutters that actually works with your content, allowing different layouts at different breakpoints, a visual order that isn't tied to your source order, and no more terrible presentational class names.

In this one hour session, I cover how to use [Singularity](https://github.com/at-import/Singularity) and combine it with [Breakpoint](https://github.com/at-import/breakpoint), why writing media queries to your content is a superior approach to trying to fit your content into prefab media queries, and how separating your visual and source order leads to a better experience on mobile devices and desktop displays.

<div style="width:100%; padding-bottom:75%; height: 0; position:relative;">
<iframe style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%;" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lkSWS64dZBM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

_(The code samples which were broken on this demo have since been fixed. The new version of Singularity was incompatible with the version of Ruby Sass that I had Sassmeister configured to use.)_
